# Configuration

Procly reads its configuration from 3 TOML files, merged in this order, each level overriding the one before key by key:

1. The user settings, in `$PROCLY_CONFIG_DIR/config.toml`, else `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/procly/config.toml`, else `~/.config/procly/config.toml`. They hold personal defaults for every Repository, so they accept the `[settings]` table only.
2. `procly.toml` at the root of the Worktree, versioned with the Repository. It declares the Services the team shares.
3. `procly.local.toml` at the root of the Worktree, excluded from git. It holds personal overrides for this Worktree.

Tables merge key by key and any other value replaces the one below, so a local file can override one port without repeating the rest of the Service. A missing file counts as empty, and an unknown key is an error, so a typo never goes unnoticed. The Daemon reads the files again on every `procly up` and `procly worktree init`, no restart is needed after an edit.

## Example

```toml
[settings]
health_timeout = "2m"

[services.web]
run = "pnpm --filter web dev"
ports = { http = 3000 }

[services.web.health]
path = "/api/health"
status = 200
timeout = "90s"

[services.worker]
run = "pnpm --filter worker start"

[worktree]
copy = [".env", "certs"]
setup = ["pnpm install"]
```

## `[settings]`

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `health_timeout` | `"1m"` | How long `up` waits for a Service to become healthy before stopping it and exiting with 124. |

Durations are written as `procly run --timeout` accepts them: `500ms`, `90s`, `5m`, `1h`, or a bare number of seconds.

## `[services.<name>]`

A Process service. The name is the one given to `procly up` and `procly down`.

| Key | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `run` | yes | The command, run by `/bin/sh -c` at the root of the Worktree, in its own process group, with the environment of the `procly up` that started it. |
| `ports` | no | The port of each Port name, such as `{ http = 3000 }`. A Service without ports, such as a queue worker, is healthy as soon as it has started. |

## `[services.<name>.health]`

Health is a TCP connection to the port of the Service, on `127.0.0.1` or `::1`, optionally followed by an HTTP `GET`.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `port` | the only Port name | The Port name to probe, required when the Service declares several. |
| `path` | none | The path of the HTTP check. Setting `path` or `status` turns the HTTP check on, with `/` as the default path. |
| `status` | `200` | The status the HTTP check must answer. |
| `timeout` | `settings.health_timeout` | The health timeout of this Service. |

## `[worktree]`

What `procly worktree init` does in a fresh Worktree, see [Preparing a Worktree](worktree-init.md). Lists replace the ones of the level below instead of adding to them.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `copy` | none | Untracked files and directories to copy from the Main worktree when the Worktree lacks them, such as env files and local certificates. Paths are relative to the root of the Worktree, an absolute path or one climbing out with `..` is an error. |
| `setup` | none | Commands run once, in order, by `/bin/sh -c` at the root of the Worktree, with the environment of the `procly worktree init` that ran them. |
